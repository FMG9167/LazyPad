# LazyPad
LazyPad is a Macropad made up of 6 keys.

This is my first time creating and submitting anything in HackClub!

## Firmware
KMK was used to make the firmware of the pad.

## BOM

- 6x MX Switched (I dont know much about them any will work i think)
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 4x M3x5x4 Heatset inserts
- 4x M3x16mm screws

## Notes
This was my first time using Fusion and KiCAD but man it worth the time.
